* The system uses an ESP32, a DHT22 sensor, and a relay module.
* The DHT22 VCC pin is connected to the 3.3V pin on the ESP32.
* The DHT22 GND pin is connected to GND on the ESP32.
* The DHT22 DATA pin is connected to a GPIO pin on the ESP32 for reading temperature and humidity.
* The relay IN pin is connected to a GPIO pin on the ESP32 to control the relay.
